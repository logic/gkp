go-keepassrpc
=============

go-keepassrpc is an implementation of the protocol provided by the KeePassRPC
plugin shipped with [KeeFox](http://keefox.org), a popular Firefox integration
for [KeePass Password Safe](http://keepass.info).

`kp` is a command-line client which uses the `keepassrpc` package to talk to
a running KeePass instance.

keepassrpc
----------

`keepassrpc` is the client library which implements the SRP protocol, the
challenge/response protocol, and eventually the JSON RPC protocol. A good
place to start would be to look at the `Client` struct and the `NewClient()`
function.

We use `jsonenums` to generate marshal/unmarshal helpers for a couple of the
enum values passed to us from the KeePassRPC service. To build, you'll need
to run:

    `go get github.com/campoy/jsonenums`

Once you have `jsonenums` in your `PATH`, run `go generate ./...` to create
the needed files.
